#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs tamarin-prover on every lemma of a model, each in a process of its own
# (one after another, so that no run holds the memory of the others), and
# compares each result with the model's expectations. tamarin-prover exits 0
# also when a lemma is falsified, the analysis is incomplete or the model is
# not well-formed, so its summary is read, not its exit code.
#
# Usage: check.sh [--all-builds] [MODEL [FLAG]]
#   MODEL         the model's file name without .spthy (chain, ...); without
#                 it, every model in this directory.
#   FLAG          a build: a preprocessor flag passed as -D=FLAG (a negative
#                 control, such as SkipLinkCheck), or default, the model
#                 without a flag, which is also what no FLAG means. A FLAG
#                 that MODEL.expected.tsv does not name as a build is refused.
#   --all-builds  every build of the model (or of every model): default and
#                 each build MODEL.expected.tsv names. A build whose results
#                 are not the expected ones does not stop the others; the
#                 last line lists every such build.
#   TIMEOUT       seconds per lemma (600 by default); a lemma that runs out of
#                 time is unresolved, not falsified. GNU timeout is used when
#                 on PATH; otherwise the run is killed from the shell.
#
# A lemma's result is one of verified, falsified, unresolved. MODEL.expected.tsv
# lists the expected result per build and lemma ("build<TAB>lemma<TAB>result");
# a lemma absent from the file is expected to be verified. Before any lemma is
# proved, the model and its expectations are checked against each other: each
# #ifdef names one flag, no lemma is inside an #ifdef, every result is one of
# the three, every lemma the file names is in the model, and the #ifdef flags
# are exactly the builds the file names other than default. The script exits 0
# only when they agree and every lemma's result is the one expected. Needs
# tamarin-prover and maude on PATH.
